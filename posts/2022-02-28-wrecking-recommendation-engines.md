I've always had eclectic taste, but I'm really enjoying wrecking Netflix's (and other streaming services) recommendation engine lately. It appears to have no idea what I am anymore. I typically watch weird indie movies and random shows from 2 to 10 years ago on my account, but I also watch a bunch of stuff with the kids - we just finished Kipo and the Age of Wonderbeasts (it was decent). And I occationally watch blockbuster movies with Andrea, or family movies. We watched the new Cowboy Bebop live action series, and it started recommending anime. I tried to watch Attack on Titan, but couldn't stand it. Despite that, I now have a whole section for anime in my Netflix suggestions. I watched a couple of French films: I am Not an Easy Man and Big Bug. A couple of Chinese sci-fi movies: Space Sweepers and Wandering Earth. The Chinese movies are really interesting because they continually emphasize teamwork instead of individual heros - maybe I'm reading into it, but it seems like the communist culture comes through. I've also just started watching some Bollywood stuff: Sooryavanshi. I'd been meaning to check out the over-the-top nearly-slapstick action Bollywood movies. It's interesting watching foreign movies to see the different bad guys - in this movie the Pakistani Muslims were the bad guys, but surprisingly, the good guys were ruthless - unlike American movies where the heroes always try to catch the villians alive so they can be "brought to justice", in this Indian movie, they just murdered them in the streets - quick justice. I put a lot of effort into breaking out of the tiny little bubble of content it typically recommends. It's meta-entertainment for me I guess - trying to confuse the recommendation engine AI - there's a surprising amount of stuff on Netflix, but once it puts you in a box, you only ever see a tiny sliver of the content on the platform, which is pretty disappointing. I wish there was an anti-recommendation engine - an option for you to just tell it to show you something completely new and different. I would love that!
