## title: "Prepper Beans" date: 2022-11-18T15:33:01-08:00

Whenever I go to Costco I like to buy a big box of canned refried beans. I like the idea of being a "prepper" - being prepared for an apocalypse - but I'm lazy, so I just buy beans. I could eat refried beans forever. I love them. When the world ends, come to my house and have some beans with me.
