I finally worked out the MIME type bug I was having with IPFS. I think I'll relaunch my website soon!

Rhys got a pretty nice haircut today.

He and Andrea went to baseball practice, and Corbin and I went on a long bike ride: Cadman park, then down the hill, past the karate dojo, all the way to Costco. We got a berry smoothie and ice cream, then walked back up the hill, and went home.

We met the Kopchinskys for lunch at EE NAMI Tonkatsu Izakaya - I had some pork curry - it was pretty good.

We went to see "Spider-Man: No Way Home" at the movie theater - I haven't been in a theater in forever! Movie was decent.

Came home, watched Youtube and Kipo and the Age of Wonderbeasts with the kids.

I've been sleeping on the couch the last week or so - Andrea gets better sleep without me in the bed, and I want to stay up late and watch junk anyway - my days feel too short - I want to squeeze more waking hours out of my life.
