I've been using Google Maps for years to keep lists. I have hundreds of places in my "Favorites" and "Want to go" lists. Google is the world's most popular search engine - their whole thing is search - and yet, I can't search my lists. If I want to see all the coffee shops in my "Want to go" list, I can't. If I only want to see my favorite places in Austin, I can't. I submitted feedback to Google about it... I should probably find some free and open source alternative... Anybody got recommendations?
