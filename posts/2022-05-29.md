Today was a good day. I spent a lot of time working on this new Hugo-powered site and I've officially relaunched evanstucker.com! I'm still learning how to make Hugo do what I want, and I still need to add some features like some kind of decentralized commenting system...

Regarding Andrea, she's still recovering really quickly! We got decent sleep last night, and she was able to go most of the day with no painkillers. We went on two short walks, and she even made lunch by herself! It's unbelievable that she's functioning this well considering what she's gone through.

The children were helpful today. Corbin and Rhys made oatmeal for us this morning. Corbin decided to start a new game in master mode on Zelda: BOTW.
