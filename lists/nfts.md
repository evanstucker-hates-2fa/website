I'm not an NFT collector, but every once in a while I find a collection that's interesting. Here are my favorites so far:

- 2017-06 [CryptoPunks](https://opensea.io/collection/cryptopunks) - I think these might be the first NFTs? I'm still baffled that people pay so much for pixelated pictures of punks.
- 2017-11 [CryptoKitties](https://opensea.io/collection/cryptokitties) - Maybe the first NFT game? Not much of a game, but it was an interesting experiment in how to gamify NFTs.
- 2021-07 [CryptoDickbutts](https://opensea.io/collection/cryptodickbutts-s3) - LOL, WTF! People pay money for this?
- 2021-07 [Damien Hirst - The Currency](https://opensea.io/collection/thecurrency) - I actually helped launch this one! I was working at ConsenSys and we partnered with HENI to help Damien Hirst create this NFT. The concept was for him to paint all of these different pieces, then, after 1 year, he would either ship you the art and burn the NFT, or burn the art and you could keep the NFT. It must have been difficult burning all of that art he created...
- 2021-11 [Toddlerpillars](https://opensea.io/collection/toddlerpillars) - I just like the aesthetic of these. Freaky.
- 2022-08 [Art Gobblers](https://opensea.io/collection/artgobblers) - created by Justin Roiland (of Rick and Morty fame)? There's some kind of goo token experiment that goes along with this. I dunno. I like the aesthetic, and the tokenomics seem different.
