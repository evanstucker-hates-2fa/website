Overview
I am a git user. I know git. I don't know Perforce. This was a helpful introduction:
http://stackoverflow.com/questions/17267218/perforce-for-git-users
Here is the actual P4 User's Guide:
http://www.perforce.com/perforce/r15.1/manuals/p4guide/index.html


Install and configure Perforce:
The only thing you should need to change is the View.
You have to log out and log back in after configuring for this to work. Otherwise you will get errors like:
Client 'evans-laptop' unknown - use 'client' command to create it.
sudo rpm --import https://package.perforce.com/perforce.pubkey
sudo bash -c $'cat << EOF > /etc/yum.repos.d/perforce.repo
[perforce]
name=Perforce
baseurl=http://package.perforce.com/yum/rhel/7/x86_64

gpgcheck=1

sudo yum install -y helix-cli

cat << EOF | p4 client -i

View the entire history of a file with all changes included
p4 filelog modules/product_a/manifests/init.pp | grep -E '^\.\.\. #' | awk '{ print $4 }' | xargs p4 describe -db | less

Cleaning up Perforce
# Change to the directory you want to clean up.
# Run this:
p4 clean

# Then clean up any empty directories (p4 ignores directories - it only cares about files...)
find . -type d -empty -delete

Moving a directory
First you have to open every file in the directory. The '...' is not me being lazy, you have to literally put an ellipsis there. That's the Perforce version of the asterisk.
p4 open ~/depot/quicksync/puppet/modules/product_a/manifests/svcaccts/...
You may have to create the destination directory too if it doesn't exist. I'm not 100% certain.
Then you can move the files:
p4 move modules/product_a/manifests/svcaccts/... modules/profile/manifests/product_a/svcaccts/...

Backing out a change that was submitted with adds and edits
From: http://answers.perforce.com/articles/KB/3474?startURL=%2Farticles%2FKB_Article%2FBacking-Out-Submitted-Changelists
p4 sync @999
p4 edit //depot/ola.txt
p4 add //depot/bar.txt
p4 sync @1000
p4 resolve -ay
p4 sync
p4 resolve
p4 delete //depot/foo.txt
p4 submit

List all my changes this month
# Number of changes
p4 changes -s submitted -u $USER @$(date +%Y/%m/23:00:00:00 -d 'last month'),@$(date +%Y/%m/22:23:59:59) | wc -l

# Content of changes
p4 changes -s submitted -u $USER @$(date +%Y/%m/23:00:00:00 -d 'last month'),@$(date +%Y/%m/22:23:59:59) | cut -d ' ' -f 2 | xargs p4 describe -db | less

Diff two files in the depot
p4 diff2 manifests/nodes/product_a.pp#108 manifests/nodes/product_a.pp#110

#Kinda like git blame
p4 annotate

p4 diff -db ecm.pp#3
p4 sync b2b.pp#4
p4 resolve (see ? to advanced options)
p4 revert
p4 opened

# Show just the file names of opened files.
p4 opened | sed -r 's#^//depot/##;s/#[0-9]+.*//;'

p4 edit
p4 submit (-d to enter desciption?)
p4 status?
