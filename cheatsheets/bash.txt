# How to print a specific section of a file
# You can do this to only print the parts of the file after "coyote":
sed -n -e '/coyote/,$p' $file
# Or you can print a middle section like this:
sed -n -e '/coyote/,/end of coyote/p' $file


# How to mount a remote file system via SSH
# Install SSHFS:
sudo yum install fuse-sshfs
# Mount the directory (do not run as root):
mkdir remote_fs
sshfs server:remote_fs -o idmap=user
# Unmount the directory:
fusermount -u remote_fs

How to find files that have been hidden under another mounted filesystem
When you have a discrepancy in file space like this, one cause could be a file system that is mounted on top of a directory that already contains
files. If there's a significant difference between du and df, you might have this issue:
[evans@server ~]$ df -Ph /var
Filesystem Size Used Avail Use% Mounted on
/dev/mapper/rootvg-var_lv 20G 16G 2.8G 86% /var
[evans@server ~]$ sudo du -xcsh /var
12G /var
12G total
[evans@sjc-mongo5 ~]$
To find out where the missing space is, you can mount /var using the --bind option to a temporary directory, then look for all file systems mounted below /var and see whether or not their mount points are empty:
[evans@server ~]$ mkdir evanstemp
[evans@server ~]$ sudo mount --bind /var evanstemp/


Print only the string that you want
This example uses Perl look-behind assertions to find fixed strings like 'command[stuff]', and print out only 'stuff':
grep -oP '(?<=command\[)([^]]+)(?=])' nrpe.cfg
If you want to find something using regex instead of just a fixed string, sed works better:
sed -n -r 's/^[ \t]*class[ \t]+(.*)[\{\(\t]+/\1/p' '{}' \;
Multiline search and replace in multiple documents
grep -rIlZ 'duck' ~/seasons/*.html | xargs -0 --no-run-if-empty sed -i -r -n '1h;1!H;${g;s/duck/wabbit/g;p;}'

Print a particular block of a YAML file
This is essentially a multi-line grep. Very useful.
http://backreference.org/2010/09/11/smart-ranges-in-awk/
http://backreference.org/2010/02/10/idiomatic-awk/
This would print all blocks that match "^java:":
awk '/^[^ ]/{p=0} /^java:/{p=1} p' java_crud.yaml

# netstat is deprecated, use ss instead
ss -lpn | grep :22

Find all running Tomcat processes of a certain version
This will find and print the catalina.base for all running Tomcats of version 7.0.55:
ps -elF | grep apache-tomcat-7.0.55 | grep -oE 'catalina\.base=[^ ]+'

Sort the lines of a file by length
awk '{ print length(), $0 | "sort -n" }' $file

Print only the username and full command
ps can print lots of things with the -o command, but the full command is not one of them, as far as I'm aware...
ps -elF | awk '{ORS=""; print $3 "\t"; for(i=17;i<NF;++i)print $i,""; ORS="\n"; print $NF;}'

Extract an RPM

Pass options from a script to a command within the script safely
In case you're adding some additional logic to an existing command, but you want to safely pass some options to the command directly. Here's an example:
#!/bin/bash
while getopts vf option; do
    case $option in
        v) rm_options+=(-v);;
        f) rm_options+=(-x);;
    esac
done
shift $(($OPTIND - 1))
for file in "$@"; do
    rm "${rm_options[@]}" ${file}
done
Using options and arguments in your script
Do not use getopt (singular). It is bad for a variety of reasons. Use getopts instead.

I always mess this up. Here's a thorough example:
while getopts :ij:rRvh option; do
    case $option in
        i) i_func;;
        j) j_arg=$OPTARG;;
        r) rflag=true; small_r=true;;
        R) rflag=true; big_r=true;;
        v) v_func; other_func;;
        h) usage; exit;;
        \?) echo "Unknown option: -$OPTARG" >&2; exit 1;;
        :) echo "Missing option argument for -$OPTARG" >&2; exit 1;;
        *) echo "Unimplemented option: -$OPTARG" >&2; exit 1;;
    esac
done
shift $(($OPTIND - 1))
echo "$@"

Get all the SSH keys
#!/bin/bash
set -euo pipefail
PATH=/bin:/usr/bin
cat <<TAC
This will wipe out your existing ~/.ssh/known_hosts and replace it with one
that's up to date as of today. This is not terribly secure, because if a
server has been hijacked, this will wipe out it's old key and you won't get
prompted about the server having a different key. However, this is very
convenient, because you won't have to type yes a thousand times if you issue
an ssh command to all servers. Ideally, we need to implement
https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4255 to put our SSH keys in DNS.
Anywho, do you want to go ahead and wipe out your existing known_hosts file? If
so, type "delete it" and press Enter.

if [[ $response == 'delete it' ]]; then

        hostname=$(echo $fqdn | cut -d '.' -f 1)
        if [[ $ip != '' ]]; then
            echo "${fqdn},${hostname},${ip}"
        fi
        ip=''

Wrapper script to send all output to syslog while still putting stderr on the console
This is really good for wrapping cronjobs that have a MAILTO. All output from the wrapped script will go to syslog, so you can go look at it if you need to, but only STDERR goes to console, which is then sent to a MAILTO.
#!/bin/bash
your_script.sh 1> >(logger -t $(readlink -f $0)) 2> >(logger -s -t $(readlink -f $0))

Unexpected command butchery due to misunderstood literals and shell-expansion
I was building lots of find commands:
find /var/log/thingy/logs -maxdepth 1 -type f -name 'goob.log.*' '!' -name '*.gz' '!' -name '*.bz2' -mtime +30 -print0
find /var/log/differentthing/logs -maxdepth 1 -type f -name 'huh.log.*' '!' -name '*.gz' '!' -name '*.bz2' -mtime +30 -print0
find /var/log/m0arstuff/logs -maxdepth 1 -type f -name 'blibblob.log.*' '!' -name '*.gz' '!' -name '*.bz2' -mtime +30 -print0
and they have some repeating options, so I put them in a variable like this:
gzip_exceptions=$'\'!\' -name \'*.gz\' \'!\' -name \'*.bz2\''
find /var/log/thingy/logs -maxdepth 1 -type f -name 'goob.log.*' $gzip_exceptions -mtime +30 -print0
find /var/log/differentthing/logs -maxdepth 1 -type f -name 'huh.log.*' $gzip_exceptions -mtime +30 -print0
find /var/log/m0arstuff/logs -maxdepth 1 -type f -name 'blibblob.log.*' $gzip_exceptions -mtime +30 -print0
The end result I wanted was something like:
find . '!' -name '*.gz'
That's it. Nothing else. No other quotes. Not find with shell expansion to list all *.gz files.
And it didn't work! Really crazy things ensued! See below:
#### Setting my shell to display all kinds of crap.
evans@bastion:~/test> set -x
++ echo -ne '\033]0;evans@bastion:~/test'

#### Just listing files. There are two:
evans@bastion:~/test> ls -l
+ ls --color=auto -l
total 0
-rw-r--r-- 1 evans users 0 Oct  9 19:28 test.log
-rw-r--r-- 1 evans users 0 Oct  9 19:28 test.log.gz
++ echo -ne '\033]0;evans@bastion:~/test'

#### Setting x to what I believed to be a literal string equal to: '!' -name '*.gz'
evans@bastion:~/test> x=$'\'!\' -name \'*.gz\''
#### Looks like Bash added some unexpected single quotes for some reason...
+ x=''\''!'\'' -name '\''*.gz'\'''
++ echo -ne '\033]0;evans@bastion:~/test'

#### However, echoing the variable showed the string I wanted.
evans@bastion:~/test> echo $x
+ echo ''\''!'\''' -name ''\''*.gz'\'''
#### Looks good, right?
'!' -name '*.gz'
++ echo -ne '\033]0;evans@bastion:~/test'

#### Fail, that + find command looks insane.
evans@bastion:~/test> find . $x
+ find . ''\''!'\''' -name ''\''*.gz'\'''
find: `\'!\'': No such file or directory
++ echo -ne '\033]0;evans@bastion:~/test'

#### Fail, putting the variable in double quotes trimmed a couple of single quotes out of the middle of the string...
evans@bastion:~/test> find . "${x}"
+ find . ''\''!'\'' -name '\''*.gz'\'''
.
./test.log.gz
./test.log
find: `\'!\' -name \'*.gz\'': No such file or directory
++ echo -ne '\033]0;evans@bastion:~/test'

#### I found a comment on http://wiki.bash-hackers.org/syntax/quoting that mentioned using an array instead...
evans@bastion:~/test> x=('!' -name '*.gz')
+ x=('!' -name '*.gz')
++ echo -ne '\033]0;evans@bastion:~/test'

#### This worked... NOT! The + find command shows that it expanded '*.gz' to test.log.gz! WTF!
evans@bastion:~/test> find . ${x[@]}
+ find . '!' -name test.log.gz
.
./test.log
++ echo -ne '\033]0;evans@bastion:~/test'

#### Like the comment showed, the array has to also be enclosed in double quotes.
evans@bastion:~/test> find . "${x[@]}"
+ find . '!' -name '*.gz'
.
./test.log
++ echo -ne '\033]0;evans@bastion:~/test'
evans@bastion:~/test>
So, here's the final working code. I had to put the strings in an array and then call the array inside double quotes:
gzip_exceptions=('!' -name '*.gz' '!' -name '*.bz2')
find /var/log/thingy/logs -maxdepth 1 -type f -name 'goob.log.*' "${gzip_exceptions[@]}" -mtime +30 -print0
find /var/log/differentthing/logs -maxdepth 1 -type f -name 'huh.log.*' "${gzip_exceptions[@]}" -mtime +30 -print0
find /var/log/m0arstuff/logs -maxdepth 1 -type f -name 'blibblob.log.*' "${gzip_exceptions[@]}" -mtime +30 -print0

Run a command on multiple servers
You need to setup SSH key-based authentication for this to work.
Here's an example using brace expansion to generate a list of servers. I put -n because of a weird problem once which I cannot explain. The -q and Strict... are just to shut everything up and give me the output I want.
for server in server{0..9}; do
    ssh -q -n -o StrictHostKeyChecking=no $server 'df -hP /var'
done
A more complex example that runs a script. I'm using a custom lssrv.sh script to generate the server list this time. I highly recommend using $'' quoting to protect the code you're sending through SSH. I also used 'sudo ssh' to run SSH as the root user because you can't pass interactive commands through SSH easily.
for server in $(lssrv.sh -a rlp -e stg); do
    sudo ssh -q -n -o StrictHostKeyChecking=no $server $'
        find /var/log/jetty -maxdepth 1 -type f \! -name \'*.gz\' -exec sh -c \'
            fuser -s "$0"; fuser_exit=$?;
            if [[ $fuser_exit == 1 ]]; then
                gzip -v "$0"
            elif [[ $fuser_exit == 0 ]]; then
                echo "WARNING: Skipping $0, file is open."
            else
                echo "WARNING: Skipping $0, fuser exit code was ${fuser_exit}."
            fi
        \' {} \;
    '
done
Here's an attempt to run a command in parallel using a little bit of rate-limiting. Note the "&" at the end of the SSH command to execute it in the background - much faster than serial execution. The output can get pretty gnarly though...
for server in $(lssrv.sh -e stg); do
    ssh -q -n -o StrictHostKeyChecking=no $server 'echo -n $(hostname); grep "[[:space:]]*server[[:space:]]*=" /etc/puppet/puppet.conf' &
    joblist=($(jobs -p))
    while (( ${#joblist[*]} > 9 )); do
        sleep 1
        joblist=($(jobs -p))
    done
done
echo "Done. Press Enter."
When you want to run things in parallel, it's easier to start using something like pdsh (pronounced "puh-doosh") or pssh. Here are some simple examples:
pssh -i -h <(lssrv.sh -e stg) -p 13 -t 30 -O StrictHostKeyChecking=no 'echo hi'

sudo pssh -i -h <(lssrv.sh -e stg) -p 13 -t 30 -O StrictHostKeyChecking=no 'tail -n 1 /var/log/messages'
Run a command only if the file is not open
This has to be run as root due to fuser.

fuser -s "${file}"; fuser_exit=$?;
if [[ $fuser_exit == 1 ]]; then
    gzip -v "${file}"
elif [[ $fuser_exit == 0 ]]; then
    echo "WARNING: Skipping ${file}, file is open."
else
    echo "WARNING: Skipping ${file}, fuser exit code was ${fuser_exit}."
fi
